# dsc-Phase1-Project-Aircraft-Risk-Analysis
Aircraft Risk Analysis
This project is focused on analyzing aviation risk factors to provide actionable insights for a company expanding into the aviation industry. The company aims to operate aircraft for commercial and private purposes but requires a data-driven approach to determine which aircraft models pose the lowest risk for their business.

Project Overview
Business Problem
Your company is diversifying its portfolio and plans to enter the aviation industry. However, the leadership team lacks insights into the risks associated with different aircraft types. You have been tasked with identifying the aircraft models that carry the least risk, based on historical accident and incident data. The analysis will provide actionable insights to help the head of the new aviation division decide which aircraft models are the best investment for the company's new venture.

The Data
The dataset contains aviation accident and incident data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), covering civil aviation accidents in the U.S. and international waters from 1962 to 2023. The data includes a wide range of features such as:

Aircraft type and model
Date and time of the accident/incident
Location and severity of the event
Weather conditions
Operator details
Fatalities and injuries
Pilot experience
Maintenance history
Key Objectives
Data Cleaning: Handle missing data, inconsistent entries, and data quality issues.
Imputation: Where data is missing, use statistical techniques to impute values based on patterns in the dataset.
Risk Analysis: Identify key factors contributing to aircraft risk and develop models to quantify risks.
Interactive Dashboard: Create a visualization dashboard for business stakeholders to explore risk factors and insights.
Recommendations: Provide recommendations on the aircraft models that pose the least risk for acquisition.
Features
Data Cleaning & Imputation: Clean and impute missing values in the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze key risk factors such as weather conditions, aircraft type, operator, and pilot experience.
Risk Factor Modeling: Build models to predict the likelihood of accidents or incidents based on historical data.
Dashboard Visualization: Create interactive visualizations to allow stakeholders to explore risks associated with different aircraft types.
Actionable Insights: Provide recommendations for aircraft acquisition based on the analysis.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization
Plotly / Dash for interactive dashboards
Install the dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aircraft-risk-analysis.git
cd aircraft-risk-analysis
Set up the environment and install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the NTSB Aviation Accident Dataset and place it in the data/ folder. If no dataset is available, follow the data collection steps below.

Data Preparation
The dataset is available from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). You can find it on their website or by using open data portals. The dataset should contain information such as:

Event date
Aircraft category
Operator type
Narrative of the accident
Injury severity
Total fatalities
Weather data
Flight phase (e.g., takeoff, landing)
Make sure to clean the data by:

Handling missing values
Addressing inconsistent data entries
Aggregating and normalizing data across relevant features
Usage
To conduct the risk analysis, follow these steps:

Data Cleaning: Run notebooks/DataCleaning.ipynb to clean and preprocess the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Run notebooks/EDA.ipynb to explore key risk factors.
Risk Modeling: Open notebooks/RiskModeling.ipynb to develop predictive models for aircraft risk assessment.
Interactive Dashboard: Use dashboard/ to run a dashboard that visualizes risk factors and provides decision-making insights.
Example: Running the Risk Modeling Notebook
bash
Copy code
cd notebooks/
jupyter notebook RiskModeling.ipynb
Output
Data Cleaning: A clean dataset ready for analysis.
EDA: Visualizations that highlight key factors affecting aircraft risk.
Risk Model: A machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of an accident based on various input factors.
Dashboard: An interactive dashboard that allows stakeholders to explore and visualize risk factors for different aircraft models.
